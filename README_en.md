# Design Principles for a Post-Capitalist Contribution Protocol for Civilizational Regeneration  
Through a peer-to-peer social currency rooted in altruistic contribution,
it becomes possible to circulate value and trust directly within communities,
without relying on capital or ownership.


This design is free to use and modify.  
No approval, contact, or supervision is required from anyone.

We must ask ourselves: what is considered valuable in today’s society—and what remains unrecognized?  
Division, isolation, apathy, and unseen goodwill.  
This protocol proposes a new circulatory system to address these gaps.  
It records actions, transforms them into value, and shares them. 
Through this mechanism, anyone can implement a structure for building trust.

This design does not rely on ownership or capital.  
Currency is issued based on contribution history.  
Speech rights and settlement authority are granted accordingly.  
The system belongs to no one—it is entrusted to those with will and to their communities.

If you are an engineer, this begins with your decision.

## Technical Overview

This protocol is designed with the following three-layer structure:

### 1. Currency Layer (Contribution Layer)
A token structure that records contributions and circulates value.

- Utility Token: Issued based on participant actions. Used for discounts, exchanges, and recirculation as expressions of gratitude.
- Governance Token: Grants variable speaking and decision-making rights based on past issuance history.
- Prestige: A non-transferable unit of evaluation based on contribution and trust. It accumulates continuously, but the evaluation period is left to the discretion of each region. It is also affected by recirculation history.

Tokens are not financial assets. They are designed as proofs of record, trust, and participation.

### 2. Governance Layer (Decision-Making Layer)
A variable participatory structure for system operation and decision-making.

- A variable democratic system is adopted, in which governance tokens are granted based on activity history and the number of votes changes accordingly.
- Voting, aggregation, and execution can be partially automated through smart contracts or similar mechanisms.
- Decision-making rights are institutionalized not through temporary ownership, but through cumulative history and continuity.


### 3. Implementation Layer (Operational Layer)  
An operational environment that allows flexible implementation according to the region or organization.

- CRM and spreadsheets are used to record participant, event, and activity histories.
- On-site operations follow a basic cycle of QR check-in → organizer approval → token issuance.
- Prestige and governance can be introduced in stages, starting with a minimal initial setup.
- The implementation infrastructure (such as CRM) is separated from token design, and can be freely replaced or extended.

These three layers are interconnected, jointly supporting the visualization of actions, institutional operation, and on-site practice.
This structure provides technical support for rebuilding a trust-based economy rooted in local communities.

## Features

- Redefining Meaningful Roles:  
  Everyone in the community can contribute within professionally meaningful domains that have been restructured in a contemporary way, such as “administration,” “agriculture,” “craftsmanship,” “knowledge,” “distribution,” and “commerce.”
Clear opportunities for action are provided to all, regardless of employment contracts or formal titles.
The system is designed to naturally empower those who perceive the essence of things—especially individuals who were previously undervalued by conventional evaluation systems.

- Non-ownership by Design:  
  The system and its currency are not owned by any specific individual or organization, but are designed as inheritable structures.

- Financial Structure:  
  This currency is designed to maintain a balance between issuance and settlement, based on its utility value and reserve assets.
Reliability is sustained through internal circulation—for example, margins generated during cash conversion are returned to the reserve.

- Circulatory Structure: 
  This currency is designed with its outlets (uses) in mind, including the provision of food, goods, services, and support for local self-governance.
It functions organically within real-world cycles of exchange and contribution.

- Easy Initial Implementation: 
  Small-scale deployment using tools like CRM and spreadsheets is possible, making the system well-suited for phased adoption.

## Structural Stability

The value of this currency does not rely solely on reserves or physical collateral.
Its trustworthiness is institutionally secured not by goodwill or custom, but by the structure itself.

At the core lies a technical foundation, such as smart contracts, that governs the issuance process and operational rules.
This technology ensures legitimacy and integrity, preventing arbitrary manipulation of issuance and takeover of the system.

Built upon this technical foundation, the following elements combine to establish trust as a resilient, structurally embedded form of credibility.

- Contract Farming (Creation):  
  Actual farmland and ongoing production activities provide physical value backing, forming trust as a shared recognition within the community.

- Citizen-led PDCA (Maintenance):
  The system maintains flexibility and sustainability through the continuous will and improvement efforts of citizens.

Technology (Control), Agriculture (Creation), and Citizens (Maintenance) —
This trinity of structures supports the essence of trust that continues to function even in times of crisis.

## Licensing and Extension

This protocol can be freely implemented by anyone, anywhere in the world, and adapted or evolved with their own naming, UI/UX, and distribution design.
Any form of implementation is acceptable. However, if the core principles—such as contribution history, prestige, governance, and non-ownership—are not reflected,
the resulting system may be considered a different lineage from this protocol.

## If You Choose to Walk with This Protocol

When you build this protocol,
please, do it with someone by your side.
Don’t create it in isolation.
This was born so that people could support one another.
