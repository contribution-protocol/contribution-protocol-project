# A Quantitative Model of a P2P Contribution Structure and Its Convergence to π

This paper mathematically proves that a P2P contribution structure, defined by a system function *H* initiated through prayer and institutional response, converges to the harmony constant **π** in its temporal limit.

## ■ Mathematical Formula (Harmonic Function and Limit of the Contribution Protocol)

H(f_i(t), g_i(t), z_i(t); ε_i, β_i) = ε_i ⋅ β_i ⋅ ∛(f_i(t) ⋅ g_i(t))  (if z_i(t) > 0), else 0  
lim_{t → ∞} H(f_i, g_i, z_i; ε_i, β_i) = π

## Structure:

- **f_i(t)**: Record of contributions  
- **g_i(t)**: Accumulated prestige (trust)  
- **z_i(t)**: System activation status (existence, visibility, receipt log)  
- **ε_i**: Prayer (initial intention to activate the system)  
- **β_i**: Institutional response (gratitude, return)

## Components of z_i:

- **p_i**: Physical presence of the system (paper, servers, ledgers, etc.)  
- **v_i**: Visibility and accessibility (whether residents recognize the system)  
- **r_i**: Frequency of records in the CRM showing that someone has received a service through the system

Tokens are granted only to the contributor (issuer), but for z to be activated, **the presence of recipients and records of reception are essential**.

```
z_i = (p_i + v_i + r_i) / 3
```

*Note:* This definition is not a weighted average but a structural evaluation of whether the system fulfills the three conditions: physicality, social visibility, and connectivity.  
If any element is lost, system vitality declines. These components also interact; for example, an increase in r_i may stimulate v_i.  
In real-world applications, introducing a threshold (e.g., z > θ) enables flexible control over system activation.

## Preconditions:

1. **z > 0 must be maintained**  
→ The system physically exists, is visible to users, and contains records of actual service receipt.

2. **f ⋅ g converges to C**  
→ The accumulation of action (f) and trust (g) remains balanced within limits and does not diverge or vanish.  
*Note:* In this protocol, f and g are structurally linked within the system; inflation or divergence is structurally eliminated.  
Therefore, this convergence is **not hypothetical but structurally guaranteed**.

3. **ε and β are stable or convergent**  
→ Prayer (ε) and response (β), the system's spiritual and social energy, must remain meaningful and continuous.  
They are not just constants but represent the living vitality of the system.  
If ε = 0, the system never begins; if β = 0, the system stops responding.  
Both are **preconditions for the system to be alive**.

## Supplement: The Meaning of Convergence to π

The constant π represents natural harmony found in circles, spheres, and waves, and it aligns structurally with the YAP signaling pathway and mitochondria.  
This model shows that when a system shares the same harmonious response structure as nature and life, it converges to π as a limit.  
The equation expresses that a system behaves like a living responsive structure and naturally converges toward harmony over time.

## Supplement: Stability of f and g

- **f_i(t)** (action records) are automatically burned after six months  
- **g_i(t)** (prestige) is updated every year  

This design prevents unchecked accumulation and maintains balance.  
As a result, **divergence of f ⋅ g is structurally excluded**.

## Conditions for a Functioning System

The system continues functioning as long as:
- minimal prayer (ε_i) is expressed  
- action (f_i) is recorded  
- and a record exists (r_i) that someone received a service via the system

Temporary absence or delay of β_i is tolerable.  
But if prolonged, it breeds **internal void**, leading to collapse.  
Lack of response is an **exception**, not the norm.  
The system must embed β_i as early as possible and take responsibility to **emotionally rescue participants**.

If prayer, action, or receipt is severed—  
and the state where "nothing reaches anyone, and no one responds" continues—  
then z = 0, and the system dies.
