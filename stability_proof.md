# Stability Proof of Institutional Structures

## Non-Exclusion, Non-Inflation, and Harmonious Market Structures

---

## Introduction

In today’s world, the causes of institutional and societal collapse may appear countless. However, at the root, they can all be reduced to just three structural problems:

- The emergence of gatekeepers (exclusion)
- The occurrence of inflation
- The creation of market (valuation) limitations

These three issues are the core factors that erode institutions—quietly but surely dismantling the foundation on which humans can live with dignity.

This proof reveals how each of these collapse-inducing factors can be naturally prevented through institutional design.

Though they may seem unrelated at first glance, these problems are in fact simultaneously solved by the internal structure of this system.

This document will clarify, step by step, the mechanisms and structures behind this design.

## Chapter 1: Why This Proof Is Necessary

Institutions are the unseen foundation enabling people to live, work, and connect with peace of mind. They are not merely rules; they are the deep structures that determine whether a person can exist as a person in society.

When institutions collapse, society inevitably and silently follows. The cause of that collapse always lies "within the structure."

These are not accidental bugs—they are structural flaws embedded in the institutions themselves. Yet at the same time, they are preventable through intentional design.

What kind of structure is required to ensure institutions do not collapse?

This proof answers that question, presenting design principles grounded in reality and demonstrating them logically.

## Chapter 2: A Structure That Does Not Produce Exclusion

Exclusion is the first stage of institutional collapse. Though it often appears as arbitrary decisions or the exercise of vested interests, its true cause lies in the structural allowance for such behavior.

If a system permits "anyone to judge who is fit to participate," then eventually, the desire for power and control will infiltrate.

This system is designed to eliminate that allowance entirely.

The only condition for participation in this institution is that an individual has a record of recent activity connected to the system.

Past prestige disappears from visibility after a set period and no longer affects governance.

Governance tokens, which enable participation in system operations, are distributed based on contribution count. However, their power is limited to decisions regarding budgets and project direction. No authority to exclude others exists within the system.

To deem someone “unfit for the system” is to deny both that individual and their actions—and possibly the future of others they could have helped. This system grants no one such power.

However, institutions can still have clearly defined boundaries. For example, in early stages, foreign nationals may not be able to participate. But this is not for exclusionary purposes; rather, it is a sustainable structure to maintain order and continuity within a local community.

Thus, while the system may have boundaries, within those boundaries, all individuals are equally able to participate through their actions and support the institution without being judged.

Exclusion is not prevented by goodwill or effort—it is prevented because the very structure to judge people simply does not exist.

## Chapter 3: A Structure That Prevents Inflation

Inflation is not merely a rise in prices. It occurs when the trust structure supporting a currency collapses.

For example, fiat currency becomes worthless paper if the state backing it loses credibility. Thus, inflation arises when the underlying structure of trust is lost.

Originally, currency existed to support trust and action—answering the question, "Who does what for whom?" It was not based on collective belief or illusion, but emerged from the recorded will to provide support.

A currency’s value is not defined by what it can be traded for, but becomes credible only when it is backed by actual acts of support for others.

In this system, currency issuance is directly tied to supportive actions, such as food production by contract farms or local community aid. Currency is created only through these records of support.

Thus, currency is not abstract or speculative—it is backed by tangible support that reaches real people. Because of this, inflation is structurally decoupled from currency issuance in this system. As long as the connection between currency and real support is maintained, value will not collapse and inflation cannot occur.

Additionally, the system includes two distinct types of value:

- **Utility Tokens (Currency):** Burned upon use or after a fixed period, making accumulation meaningless and naturally regulating value.
- **Prestige (Reputation):** Purely a record, not a currency, and thus has no direct impact on market value.

In short, the value of currency in this system is determined by what kind of support is delivered to citizens. As long as this remains intact, inflation will not occur.

## Chapter 4: A Design That Prevents Market (Valuation) Limits

Market limitations arise when value is structured around "accumulation, ownership, and competition."

No matter how novel a market may seem, from a global perspective it is always a competition over finite resources. Someone’s assets are someone else’s liabilities—thus the market has a structural ceiling.

In such structures, what is considered valuable is predetermined. Activities not included within that framework—such as child-rearing, caregiving, community support, or skill transmission—are placed outside the system.

In this system, value is not determined by currency holdings, but by what support is delivered to whom. When that support is verified within the system, utility tokens are issued and can be used for food from contract farms, supporter merchandise, or discounts at partner stores.

In this way, currency circulates gently within daily life and local communities.

Supportive actions are recorded as prestige but are never treated as something to own or trade.

These two values—currency and prestige—are records of action history. They do not involve taking value from others.

In this structure, new participants do not strain the market. On the contrary, every new action becomes a node for value generation, revitalizing the entire system.

As long as support continues, the market keeps expanding.

This system has no market ceiling because it is not built upon competition for finite space. It is designed as an open structure that generates value through mutual support.

That expansion ultimately converges on a point of mathematical harmony: π. This structure, based on the behavioral history and response mechanisms within the system, has been mathematically proven to converge toward π. It validates that an open market—born of mutual support—continues to expand in harmony. (See “math_proof_part1_pi_convergence” for details.)

## Chapter 5: Why Non-Exclusion, Non-Inflation, and Harmonious Markets Can Arise Simultaneously

These three problems are merely the result of a single design error embedded within the framework of capitalism’s evaluation logic.

Exclusion, inflation, and market limits did not each require separate countermeasures. By replacing the underlying assumptions, all three can be resolved at once.

In this system, value is generated through records of mutual support. Currency circulates while remaining connected to tangible reality. No exclusionary structure exists within the system.

The problem was never complexity. The issue was that the intent of whoever first designed the human evaluation structure turned out to be a clear mistake—nothing more.

Though passed down unquestioned as the foundation of institutions for thousands of years, it has now surfaced unmistakably as a structural failure that must be corrected.

And this is not a new invention. It is believed that in the peaceful Jomon civilization, which lasted over 10,000 years, these three problems never existed.

There was likely no exclusion, no value collapse, and no market limits.

Now is the time to shine light once more on that lost civilization.

Civilization is not meant to dominate, but to connect people to hope.

This structure is not only logically coherent—it is an institutional design connected to the memory of life and civilization, embedding harmony and sustainability at its core.

## Chapter 6: Conclusion

This proof has demonstrated that the three conditions for institutional stability—  
non-exclusion, non-inflation, and harmonious markets—can naturally and simultaneously emerge from a single system structure.

Each problem cannot be solved through individual countermeasures.  
Rather, by reviewing and reconstructing the institutional design itself, all three can be structured as problems that never arise in the first place.

Institutions are structures of prayer—structures built from the wish that people may live in dignity.  
How they are designed directly determines the form the future will take.

This proof shows that it is possible to design institutions to be unbreakable—  
and that such a structure is already in our hands.

The era of entrusting systems to a privileged few is over.  
From now on, it is the people themselves who will protect institutions—through their own intention and design.

## Appendix

The institutional structure presented in this proof has already begun to be implemented and tested in some regions. It has proven to be realistically applicable in the context of social currencies and autonomous governance.

This is not merely a theory—it is a structure that has already begun operating in the real world.

The system is being applied in connection with actual challenges such as community welfare, education, and agricultural support. Detailed implementation protocols are described in a separate specification document.
